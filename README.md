Description

I want to make a lightweight AR travel diary where people can drop a little dancing ginger
bread man to wherever location they have travelled to. I love traveling and this is also targeted
towards people who love traveling. This is to bring back memories and add something fun on
top of just pictures. They would be able to come back later and still see the dancing ginger
bread man. If the ginger bread man has been planted for more than a year or so, it may also
get bigger and change color or wear unexpected outfits. I plan to also give users the ability to
edit the look of the ginger bread man by either customizing or import their own models. I plan
on using ARKit and React native and probably only the iPhone since people will probably not
carry around an iPad when they are traveling.
